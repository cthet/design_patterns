## Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern, is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful for decoupling the creation of objects from their usage.

**How It Works:**

1. **Product Interface:** This defines the interface of objects the factory_method method will create.

2. **Concrete Products:** These are different implementations of the product interface.

3. **Creator (or Factory) Class:** This is an abstract class or interface with the factory_method method, which is responsible for returning an object of the product interface.

4. **Concrete Creators:** Subclasses of the creator class that override the factory_method method to return instances of concrete products.

**Advantages:**

1. **Decoupling:** The Factory pattern decouples the implementation of the product from the client that uses it. The client code only needs to know about the abstract class or interface, not the concrete implementations.

2. **Single Responsibility Principle:** The factory_method method encapsulates the creation logic for the products, keeping it separate from the main business logic of the application.

3. **Open/Closed Principle:** The pattern is open for extension but closed for modification. New types of products can be introduced without changing the existing client code.

4. **Ease of Expansion:** Introducing new variants of products only requires adding new subclasses without changing the existing client code or factory_method logic.

5. **Readability and Organization:** The Factory pattern can lead to more organized code by separating the creation logic into distinct classes or methods.

The Factory pattern is widely used when a class doesn't know what subclasses will be required to create, when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates, or when families of related objects are designed to be used together.

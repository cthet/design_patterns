## Abstract factory

The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's especially useful when a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented, and when the system is configured with one of multiple families of products.

**How It Works:**

1. **Abstract Factory:** This is an interface that declares a set of methods for creating abstract products. These products are related or dependent but are from different product families.

2. **Concrete Factory:** These are specific classes that implement the abstract factory interface. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific family of products.

3. **Abstract Products:** These are interfaces for a family of products. Each product in the product family should have an interface.

4. **Concrete Products:** These are concrete classes that implement the abstract product interfaces. Each concrete product is created by a corresponding concrete factory.

5. **Client:** The client code works with factories and products only through their abstract interfaces. This allows the client to work with any product families created by the concrete factories.

**Advantages:**

1. **Isolation of Concrete Classes:** The client is isolated from the implementation details of the created objects. Changing product families is easy as it involves substituting one factory with another.

2. **Consistency Among Products:** The products created by a single factory are guaranteed to be compatible with each other.

3. **Promoting Consistency:** It's easier to enforce consistency among the products since a single factory creates all the products.

4. **Ease of Exchanging Product Families:** The abstract factory makes it easy to switch between different product families simply by changing the concrete factory instance.

5. **Supporting Multiple Product Variants:** An application can support various product variants from different factories.

The Abstract Factory pattern is particularly useful when the client doesn't care about the specifics of creating products as long as they get products that fit well together. It's widely used in libraries and frameworks where implementation details are expected to be extended by client code.

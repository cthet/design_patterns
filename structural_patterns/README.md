## Structural Patterns


Structural patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that deal with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

These patterns focus on simplifying the design by identifying relationships between entities, making it easier to create, understand, and manage complex systems.

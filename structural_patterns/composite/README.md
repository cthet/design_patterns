## Composite

The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**How It Works:**

1. **Component Interface:** This is an interface or an abstract class that declares common operations for both simple and complex objects of the composition.

2. **Leaf:** These are the basic building blocks of the composition. A leaf has no children and defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition.

3. **Composite:** A composite is an object that has children. It stores leaf components and implements the operations in the component interface, which typically involve iterating over its children and applying the operation to each child.

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplified Client Code:** Clients can treat composite structures and individual objects uniformly without being concerned about their concrete classes. This simplifies client code when dealing with complex tree structures.

2. **Flexibility in Structure:** The composite pattern allows for building complex objects by recursively composing them in a tree structure. This provides great flexibility in defining structures that can be as deep and as complex as needed.

3. **Ease of Modification:** New types of components can be added easily since the client code works with the interface or abstract class, not concrete classes directly. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.

4. **Clear Structure:** The pattern organizes objects into tree structures that represent part-whole hierarchies, making it clear what is a component and what is a composite of components.

Overall, the Composite pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to implement hierarchical structures (like graphical user interfaces, file systems, etc.) and want to work with these structures in a unified manner without having to differentiate between individual elements and their compositions.

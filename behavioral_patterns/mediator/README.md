## Mediator

Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.

The Mediator is a centralized intermediary through which different components of a system can communicate and interact. Instead of components calling each other directly, they use a mediator object to facilitate and control the interaction. This reduces the direct dependencies between the components, promoting looser coupling and easier maintainability.

Key components of the Mediator pattern include:

1. **Mediator Interface**: Defines the interface for communication and interaction, typically with methods for sending and receiving messages or data.

2. **Concrete Mediator**: Implements the mediator interface and coordinates communication between various components. It knows how to process the requests from the components and can pass messages between them.

3. **Components**: These are the classes that interact with each other. Instead of communicating directly, they use the mediator. They have a reference to the mediator and may have methods for sending and receiving messages through it.

The primary benefit of the Mediator pattern is that it reduces the complexity of communication in a system. Components only need to know about the mediator, not about each other, making them more modular, easier to understand, and easier to change.

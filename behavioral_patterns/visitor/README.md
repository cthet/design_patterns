## Visitor

The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This pattern involves a visitor class that changes the executing algorithm of an element class. By doing so, it allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying them.

**How It Works:**

1. **Visitor Interface:** This interface declares a set of visit methods for each type of concrete element that can be visited. These methods determine what action the visitor should take when it encounters each type of element.

2. **Concrete Visitor:** Classes that implement the Visitor interface. Each visitor is responsible for some specific kind of operation on elements. When a visitor is passed to an element, the element calls the appropriate visit method on the visitor.

3. **Element Interface:** This interface declares an `accept` method that takes a visitor as an argument.

4. **Concrete Element:** These classes implement the Element interface and define the `accept` method. The accept method usually calls the visit method on the visitor, passing itself as an argument.

5. **command.iterator.mediator.memento.observer.state.state.strategy.template_method.visitor.src.adapter.src.media_adapter.singleton.factory.Client:** The client creates Visitor objects and Element objects, and then it gives each element the visitor to execute the relevant operation.

**Advantages:**

1. **Separation of Concerns:** It separates the algorithm from the object structure. Changes to the object structure do not affect visitor logic and vice versa.

2. **Extensibility:** New operations can be added to existing object structures without modifying them. You can create new visitors for different operations.

3. **Maintain Open/Closed Principle:** Elements' classes remain closed for modifications but open for extensions by adding new visitors.

4. **Accumulating State:** Visitors can accumulate state as they visit each element in a structure.

In summary, the Visitor pattern is particularly useful when you need to perform various unrelated operations across a complex object structure without changing the classes of the elements. It's powerful for situations where you need to apply operations that don't necessarily belong to the class hierarchy of elements.
